I’ve been working with Jordan since 2004. Since that time, he has presented me with many high caliber candidates.
I’ve hired a number of his candidates and many of them turned out to be my best employees Not only does Jordan
provide quality candidates that fit our needs, but he doesn’t present resumes that are not in line with what we are
value his input and advice. He is very well plugged in to the candidates in the New England region and has a
national reputation for recruiting senior level audit professionals. I highly recommend Jordan if you are looking for great talent!
